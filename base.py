Hansel brought flowers to his beloved girlfriend on January 10, 1970,
Gretel was her name.

It was an excellent year in hansel's life. He had 5 children, all of whom are now adults.
gretel, now his wife, still makes that coffee and cheese bread on afternoons
Sunday. Also right! Being the good country girl that she is, she never forgets her famous
cheese bread.
I never tire of listening to Gretel:
"Haaaaaaaansellllll, the coffee is ready here. Cooomme"!
